This project creates a fixed-position navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu remains visible during scrolling. It changes style (background, text color) when hovered or scrolled. JavaScript detects scroll events, adding/removing classes to change the appearance, making the navigation more interactive and engaging.
